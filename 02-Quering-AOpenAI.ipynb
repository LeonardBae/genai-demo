        "But before dealing with the utility chain needed, let's first review the concept of Embeddings and Vector Search and RAG. \n",
        "\n",
        "## Embeddings and Vector Search\n",
        "\n",
        "From the Azure OpenAI documentation ([HERE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/embeddings?tabs=python)), An embedding is a special format of data representation that can be easily utilized by machine learning models and algorithms. The embedding is an information dense representation of the semantic meaning of a piece of text. Each embedding is a vector of floating point numbers, such that the distance between two embeddings in the vector space is correlated with semantic similarity between two inputs in the original format. For example, if two texts are similar, then their vector representations should also be similar. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Do We Need Vectors?\n",
        "\n",
        "Vectors are essential for several reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Semantic Richness**: They convert the semantic meaning of text into mathematical vectors, capturing nuances that simple keyword searches miss. This makes them incredibly powerful for understanding and processing language.\n",
        "- **Human-like Searching**: Searching using vector distances mimics the human approach to finding information based on context and meaning, rather than relying solely on exact word matches.\n",
        "- **Efficiency in Scale**: Vector representations allow for efficient handling and searching of large datasets. By reducing complex text to numerical vectors, algorithms can quickly sift through vast amounts of information.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Understanding LLM Tokens' Context Limitation\n",
        "\n",
        "Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT come with a token limit for each input, which poses a challenge when dealing with lengthy documents or extensive data sets. This limitation restricts the model's ability to understand and generate responses based on the full context of the information provided. It becomes crucial, therefore, to devise strategies that can effectively manage and circumvent this limitation to leverage the full power of LLMs.\n",
        "\n",
        "To address this challenge, the solution incorporates several key steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Segmenting Documents**: Breaking down large documents into smaller, manageable segments.\n",
        "2. **Vectorization of Chunks**: Converting these segments into vectors, making them compatible with vector-based search techniques.\n",
        "3. **Hybrid Search**: Employing both vector and text search methods to pinpoint the most relevant segments in relation to the query.\n",
        "4. **Optimal Context Provision**: Presenting the LLM with the most pertinent segments, ensuring a balance between detail and brevity to stay within token limits.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Our ultimate goal is to rely solely on vector indexes and hybrid searchs (vector + text). While it is possible to manually code parsers with OCR for various file types and develop a scheduler to synchronize data with the index, there is a more efficient alternative: **Azure AI Search has automated chunking strategies and vectorization**.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that **document segmentation and vectorization have already been completed in AI Azure Search**, as seen in the `ordered_content` dictionary. This pre-processing step simplifies subsequent operations, ensuring rapid response times and adherence to the token limits of the chosen OpenAI model.\n"
